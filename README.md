This is the sample code demoed in class.  You can view it here on Github, but you can also use Git to download the entire repository to your own Linux VM.  To do so, use the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/QU-CMPS405-Fall2016/samplecode

Note that you may need to install git first.  On Fedora, use a command like:

    yum install git

In Ubuntu, try:
    
    apt-get install git
